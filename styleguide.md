# Most common corrections throughout

* Dependent clauses of more than 4 words that begin a sentence (e.g., "_Because_ I went to the store", "_Since_ he had to leave early", "_If_ you are making a lot of bread", "_When_ he found the body") need a comma before the main part of the sentence.  Phrases with fewer words may still want a comma to be more readable.
* When units are abbreviated, there needs to be a space in between the numeral and the unit (e.g., 50 g)
* Chemical formulae use the `chemformula` package. `CO2` is created as `\ch{CO2}`
* "Much" should be substituted in most cases of the word "way" in order to be less casual.  E.g., "way more acidic" vs. "much more acidic"
* Phrases such as "The more the x, the less y" need a comma separating the two ideas
* Add a comma for initial adverbs such as however, lastly, furthermore, etc. (not everyone does this, but the book so far usually uses commas here, so we're adopting this standard to make the book internally consistent)
